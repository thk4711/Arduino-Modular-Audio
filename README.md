# Arduino-Modular-Audio

The idea of this project is to create a Arduino sketch which can be used to control various audio chips over I2C to allow building up an Amplifier that can be customized to the need of the user. These needs might be:

- Number of inputs
- Tone adjustments
- Number of outputs
- Volume Adjustments
- VU meeter
- Spectrum analyzer
- Gain adjustment
- ...

I am just starting with it and lets see how far I can get ;-)
